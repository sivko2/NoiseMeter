The Noise meter records sounds in the vicinity of the device and calculates their levels in decibels.

The sound leIF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HIRE ME FOR DEVELOPMENT OF JAVA DESKTOP, MOBILE (IOS AND ANDROID), TV, IOT OR SERVER (JAVAEE) APPS, PLEASE CONTACT ME AT ROMAN@PRONIC.SI !!!vel depends on the distance between the sound source and the place of measurement, and varies slightly among different devices due to their microphone characteristics.

WARNING: You MUST accept permissions otherwise the device will not measure the sound and will show the lowest measurement possible (14 dB)!!!

Device limitation: When using the Noise meter the speaker is disabled.

Bear in mind that it is impossible to reduce the sound pressure and sound intensity to zero, unless you go to a vacuum, because of the thermal motion of molecules.

Here are some referential ratings:
Loud noise ... 80 dB
Vacuum cleaner ... 70 dB 
Conversation ... 60 dB 
Average home ... 50 dB
Quiet library ... 40 dB
Quiet bedroom at night ... 30 dB
Sound of breathing at 1 m distance ... 25 dB
